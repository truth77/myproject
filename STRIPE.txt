Here are the key URLs and endpoints used in the subscription implementation:

1. **Frontend Routes**:
   - Subscription Page: `/subscription`
   - User Profile: `/profile`
   - Premium Content: `/premium-content`

2. **Backend API Endpoints**:
   - Get Subscription Plans: `GET /api/subscriptions/plans`
   - Create Checkout Session: `POST /api/subscriptions/create-checkout-session`
   - Customer Portal: `GET /api/subscriptions/portal`
   - Premium Content: `GET /api/premium/content`

3. **Stripe Integration**:
   - Checkout Session: `stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId })`
   - Webhook Endpoint: `/api/webhooks/stripe` (for handling subscription events)

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your Stripe publishable key
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe secret key (backend only)
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: For verifying webhook signatures

5. **External URLs**:
   - Stripe Dashboard: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/`
   - Stripe API Docs: `https://stripe.com/docs/api`
   - Stripe Checkout: `https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout`

Would you like me to provide more details about any of these endpoints or help you set up the required environment variables?
